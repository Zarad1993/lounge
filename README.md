# Lounge
CLI tool that sets up your development environment for contributing with one line command

## Prerequisite
* Fork the repo you are wishing to contribute.

## Objectives
- Run a simple command like `lounge react` that:
   * Clones repository that you forked from your GitHub account
   * Runs all the shell commands needed to set you up for development (i.e: cd repo, npm install, npm run tests). Based on a predefined recipe in Lounge

- For corporates and private projects. You could define the recipe in your private project. With a usage like `lounge --repo <your-private-project> --recipe-file <file-name>`

_With the hopes that you should then be ready to submit your first pull request faster_
